# Personal Website Project

This repository serves as the foundation for my journey in building a unique and dynamic web presence.
This repo will also be the testfield to test anything I learnt in web & full stack development.
The personal website should be a fun place, getting rid of the tedious cheap talks. We've seen those too much these days.
It should function as the platform to show fun stuff I made, discovery I found and weird thoughts I had.

## About the Project

This website is based on the [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project. A big thanks to the original author for providing such a fantastic starting point! While this project begins with the starter blog, I plan to heavily modify and expand it to suit my vision.

## Planned Features

Here are some of the exciting features and modifications I aim to implement:

- **Custom Design**: Tailoring the website's appearance to reflect my personal style and preferences.
- **Interactive Gadgets**: Embedding interesting and fun gadgets to enhance user engagement. (In Progress)
- **AI Integration**: Deploying an AI agent to provide intelligent and interactive functionalities. (In Progress)
