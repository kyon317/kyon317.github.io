My name is Vincent, a Master's student in the Professional Computer Science program at Simon Fraser University (SFU), Canada.
I have a strong background in programming and machine learning, with experience in full-stack development.

Currently, I am a Teaching Assistant for CMPT 310 (Artificial Intelligence), where I help students grasp AI concepts and programming techniques.
I also have a keen interest in computer vision, optimization problems, and algorithmic efficiency, often working on projects that involve difussion and transformer.

Beyond academics, I enjoy solving challenging algorithm problems, exploring new programming paradigms like Go, and contributing to web and AI-driven applications.
I am always open to new research opportunities and collaborations, particularly in computer vision, deep learning, and software development.
