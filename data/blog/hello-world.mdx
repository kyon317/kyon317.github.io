This is the Hello World of this new website.

I rebuilt the website recently as the old one is not just old in its tech stack but at a certain point it fails to reflect myself.
There are some really fancy gadgets out there off-shelf, and more learning ahead.

The transition could take some time as I am migrating all the data.

I've found deep learning a really attracting topic comparing to full-stack development. A totally different field, lots of unknowns.

Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
