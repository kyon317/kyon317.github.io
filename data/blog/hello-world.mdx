This is the "Hello World" post for this new website.

I recently rebuilt the website because the old one was not only outdated in its tech stack but also failed to reflect who I am anymore. There are many exciting tools and technologies available now, and I look forward to learning and experimenting with them.

The transition may take some time as I migrate all the data.

This repository serves as the foundation for my journey in building a unique and dynamic web presence. It will also act as a testing ground for everything I learn about web and full-stack development. My personal website should be a fun and engaging space, free from the tedious, superficial content we often see these days. Instead, it will showcase fun projects, interesting discoveries, and quirky ideas.

Some ideas I have right now:

1. Deploy a RAG AI chatbot with a customized knowledge base.
2. Create a playground featuring small games or computer graphics experiments using WebGL.
3. Work on computer vision projects, including robotics and embedded programming (ordering a Raspberry Pi now).
4. Write journals on my personal perspective of the world we are living in.
5. Publish more visual computing projects on deep learning, including the papers I've read so far.
